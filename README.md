# AI Violence or NonViolence Video Classification

This project utilizes Mobilenet_v2, a convolutional neural network architecture, to predict whether a given MP4 video contains violent content or not. The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of labeled videos to accurately classify violence in real-time.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used to build and train the image classification model.
- **Mobilenet_v2**: Keras image classification model
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations in Python, used for handling arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations in Python, used for displaying images and charts.

## Features

- **Video Classification**: The AI model can classify images into two categories: Violence and NonViolence.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves more than 90% high accuracy in distinguishing between Violence and NonViolence, making it reliable for real-world applications.
- **Scalability**: The model can be easily integrated into larger applications or systems for security classification tasks.
